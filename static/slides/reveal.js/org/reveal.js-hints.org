Presentations are generated with
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]]
and make use of the HTML presentation framework
[[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]].

- Key bindings and navigation
  - Press “?” to see key bindings of reveal.js
  - In general, “n” and “p” move to next and previous slide; mouse
    wheel works as well
  - Up/down (swiping, arrows) move within sections,
    left/right jump between sections (type “o” to see what is where)
  - Type slide’s number followed by Enter to jump to that slide
  - Browser history (buttons, Alt-CursorLeft, Alt-CursorRight; may
    need /two/ attempts to work)
  - Zoom with Ctrl-Mouse or Alt-Mouse
  - Search with Ctrl-Shift-F (press “enter” for subsequent search hits)
- PDF export
  - Change the URL by adding ~?print-pdf~ after ~.html~
    (e.g., ~https://oer.gitlab.io/OS/Operating-Systems-JiTT.html?print-pdf~),
    then print to PDF file (usually, Ctrl-p)
    - Reveal.js documents this to work with Chromium/Chrome,
      [[https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/][suggested settings]]
  - Alternatively, depending on the specific project, PDFs might also
    have been generated via LaTeX from org source files.  If
    available, those PDF versions are accessible by replacing
    ~.html~ in a presentation’s URL with ~.pdf~
  - Alternatively, instead of PDF export you may want to download and
    annotate/enrich source files
    - [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], which is plain text
- Offline use
  - Presentations can be downloaded from build pipelines of
    source projects as self-contained zip archives
    - Extract contents and open local HTML file(s) in browser
    - E.g., for a course on Operating Systems, go to
      [[https://gitlab.com/oer/OS/-/pipelines][its pipelines page]],
      click on download icon of most recent pipeline
  - Alternatively, clone source repository and build presentations locally
- Audio
  - If audio is embedded, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg][the free Ogg format]] is used
    - Based on student feedback, playback does /not/ start automatically
      - See [[https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/audio-slideshow#user-content-compatibility-and-known-issues][compatibility and known issues of the underlying audio plugin]]
      - [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/][Firefox]],
        seems to work everywhere
    - Audio controls are shown at bottom left (use right-click for
      more controls such as Play Speed)
    - Type “+” to toggle audio
- Notes
  - Slides contain additional notes as plain text if you see the
    folder icon
    [[./reveal.js/dist/theme/folder_inbox.png]]
    - Press “v” to open the “courseware view” or click on that icon or
      press “s” to see the “speaker notes view”
      - For the speaker notes view you need to allow pop-ups
      - If the pop-up window does not work, you may need to press “s”
        twice or close the pop-up window once
  - If the slide contains audio, the notes are a transcript of the
    audio’s text
- Links
  - In presentations, internal and external links (the former are also
    called relative, while the latter embed a domain in the URL) are styled
    differently
    - Different colors for internal (blue) and external (green) links
      - Internal links that stay within the presentation come with
        additional indicators whether they point to a previous (◂) or
        an upcoming (▸) slide
    - Special link icon for “non-local” links
      - E.g., in this
        [[https://moz.com/learn/seo/external-link][external link to a page explaining external links]],
        which are typically served by independent organizations with
        their own agendas, with or without their own privacy policies
      - But also for links between different presentations (in
        particular, this allows to recognize forward references, which
        may be safely ignored upon first contact)
    - In summary, presentations (not this page) use four link styles:
      - External (green with icon)
      - Relative into different presentation (blue with icon)
      - Relative within presentation (blue), either with backward (◂) or
        forward (▸) indicator
  - Some students ask for the removal of links.  This can be
    configured by adding ~?hidelinks~ after ~.html~ in the URL, which
    hides most links.  In addition, with a numeric value such as
    ~?hidelinks=24~, different types of links are hidden based on the
    following bit values:
    - 1: Hide backward links
    - 2: Hide forward links
    - 4: Hide links between presentations
    - 8: Hide links to other resources under ~oer.gitlab.io~
    - 16: Hide external links
    E.g., with ~?hidelinks=28~ (28 = 16 + 8 + 4) neither external
    links (16) nor links to other resources under ~oer.gitlab.io~ (8)
    nor links to other presentations (4) would be displayed
